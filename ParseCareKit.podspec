  s.description      = <<-DESC
  This framework is an API to synchronize [CareKit](https://github.com/carekit-apple/CareKit) 2.0+ data with [parse-server](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server). Note that CareKit data is extremely sensitive and you are responsible for ensuring your parse-server meets HIPAA compliance. Look at hipaa-mongo and [hipaa_mongo](https://github.com/netreconlab/hipaa_mongodb) and [hipaa-postges]()(will post soon) to get started with HIPAA compliant databases that can be configured with pare-server. An example of how to use parse-server with [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) and [parse-dashboard](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-dashboard) can be found at [parse-postgres](https://github.com/netreconlab/parse-postgres).
